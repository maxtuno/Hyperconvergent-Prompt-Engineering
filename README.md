# Hyperconvergent-Prompt-Engineering

Engineering that combines the speed in task execution with the integration of hyperconvergent technologies, involving a convergence of computing, storage, and networking resources in a unified and agile environment, with a high degree of human interaction and artificial intelligence.

This repository serves as my portfolio to showcase what can be achieved with rapid hyperconvergent engineering. Currently, I work as a full-time artist, but I have incorporated several technologies, including artificial intelligence, into my workflow. Generally, I will only display the results, as the process is extremely complex to archive, except in videos, which I may create in the future. It is important to emphasize that rapid hyperconvergent engineering involves a high level of human interaction and is not limited to simple text. It requires advanced skills in the areas where it is applied to take what can be done with artificial intelligence to higher levels, achievable only through expert human use and interaction.
